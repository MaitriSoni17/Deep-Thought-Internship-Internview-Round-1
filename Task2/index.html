    <!-- Hello Sir, While attempting to retrieve data from the API, I consistently encountered errors. 
     To isolate the issue, I've double-checked my code and ensured it's functioning as expected. 
     Could there be any known server-side issues that might be causing this? Thank You for your time and consideration. -->
